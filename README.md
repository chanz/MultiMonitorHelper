# MultiMonitorHelper
AutoHotkey App that provides some features for Windows systems.

# Features
- Trap the mouse within one monitor. This is usefull for games or other applications where clicking "outside" of that application will result in minimizing, crashing or flickering.
- Optional: Trap the mouse ONLY when there is fullscreen application active (by default on).
- Define a hotkey to disable the mouse trap temporarily (default is ctrl + shift).
- Define a hotkey to minimize all windows on only one monitor (default is win + d, this will override the default Microsoft Windows behaviour).

# Installation

Be sure that these files are present in the same folder as the MultiMonitorHelper.exe file: config.ini, default_config.ini

# Usage
